## Feature Construction in Machine Learning

Feature construction is the process of creating new features (or variables) from existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models. It involves transforming raw data into a more useful form by generating informative features that better capture underlying patterns.
Custom features based on business logic or domain knowledge.
Example: In finance, constructing a feature like Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E) from stock price and earnings.
Why Feature Construction?

    Enhances model interpretability.
    Improves predictive power by making patterns more explicit.
    Reduces model complexity by providing meaningful representations.
