## **What is Binarization?**  
Binarization is the process of converting **numerical** or **continuous** data into **binary values (0 and 1)** based on a **threshold**. This is useful when we want to differentiate between two categories or simplify complex numerical data.  

## **Why Use Binarization?**  
- **Simplifies data representation** by converting it into two categories.  
- **Enhances model performance** in classification tasks.  
- **Useful for feature engineering**, especially for algorithms sensitive to numerical magnitudes.

## **How Does Binarization Work?**  
A threshold \( T \) is chosen, and each value is transformed as follows:  

If `x >= T`, then `y = 1`, else `y = 0`

### ** Example:**  
For a dataset of exam scores:  
`[30, 45, 60, 80, 90]`  

If the threshold is **50**, the binarized values become:  
`[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`

## **Types of Binarization**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Global Threshold Binarization**  
A single threshold is used for all data points.  
**Example:** Converting income into **"High (1)"** and **"Low (0)"** based on a fixed value.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Adaptive Binarization**  
The threshold is determined dynamically, such as using the **mean** or **median** of the data.  
**Example:** If the median salary is **50K**, salaries above it are labeled **1**, and below it are labeled **0**.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ One-Hot Encoding (For Categorical Data)**  
If a numerical feature represents categories (e.g., ratings **1-5**), binarization can convert them into **multiple binary columns**.  
**Example:**  
For ratings **1, 2, 3**, we can create three binary features:  
- `Rating_1: [1, 0, 0]`  
- `Rating_2: [0, 1, 0]`  
- `Rating_3: [0, 0, 1]`

## **üîπ Conclusion:**  
Binarization is a **simple yet powerful** transformation technique. It is widely used in **classification tasks**, **text processing**, and **machine learning models** where binary decisions simplify computation.
