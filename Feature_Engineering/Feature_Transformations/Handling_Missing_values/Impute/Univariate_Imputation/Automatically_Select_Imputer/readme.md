# **Automatic Selection Imputer Using GridSearchCV**  
In **Automatic Selection Imputation**, we use **GridSearchCV** to find the best imputation strategy by testing multiple methods and selecting the one that optimizes model performance.

---

## **How It Works**  
1. **Define multiple imputation strategies** (e.g., mean, median, mode, constant value).  
2. **Use GridSearchCV** to test each strategy during cross-validation.  
3. **Select the best imputation method** based on the model’s performance on validation data.  
4. **Apply the best imputation strategy** to preprocess missing values before training.

## **Benefits** 
- **Finds the best imputation method automatically** instead of relying on assumptions.  
- **Optimizes model performance** by selecting the most effective strategy.  
- **Works well in ML pipelines** as part of hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Handles both numerical and categorical missing values.**  

## **When to Apply?** 
- When you **don’t know which imputation method** is best for a given dataset.  
- When working with **large datasets** where manual selection is impractical.  
- When aiming to **maximize model accuracy** by tuning preprocessing steps.  

## **Disadvantages**  
- **Computationally expensive** – Testing multiple strategies increases training time.  
- **May overfit** if the dataset is small.  
- **Needs careful validation** – Performance improvement should generalize to unseen data.
